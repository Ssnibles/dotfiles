# --- Environment variables for Wayland/NVIDIA fix ---
# Prioritize WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER as it's often the most effective
export WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1

# If the above doesn't work, try these one by one or in combination:
# export __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1
# export GSK_RENDERER=gl # or ngl
# export GDK_BACKEND=x11 # Use only as a last resort for Wayland compatibility
